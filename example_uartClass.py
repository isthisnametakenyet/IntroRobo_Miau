class UartClass:
    """A class used to simplify and use the micropython UART
    
    The UartClass has been used in the subject of "Introducci√≥ a la Robotica"
    as an example of the expected results. For further reference on how to
    document a class check:
    https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html
    
    Aditionally to the documentation, this example class will keep the length
    of lines in the code under 80 characters, as it is a well known good
    practice to keep code readable.
    
    This class will initialize a micropython UART with a fixed boudrate.
    It offers a writing interface in the function send_command() and a
    listening thread on the background that will update flag_start and
    flag_stop upon receiving a "start" or "stop" message.
    
    Internally the messages are sent using the JSON format as it will improve
    scalability of the class. Messages after parsing are stored in a dictionary
    that can be accessed by name of the field instead of by index.
    

    Attributes
    ----------
